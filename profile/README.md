## Hello There 👋

> 🙋‍♀️ We are a (very) small group of knowledge workers at ANATEL - Brazil who usually go the extra mile ( or ten ) to make the collective work of our peers more efficient, aligned with the best practices and ( hopefully! ) more meaningful and enjoyable.

🌈 Guidelines of our work:

- Carrying out research, development and innovation in tools used by Anatel field teams dedicated to the regulatory enforcement of  telecommunications and broadcasting services;

- Improve, consolidate and disseminate the methodologies used for inspection;

- Reduce costs and increase efficiency in inspection processes;

- To study and apply the best inspection practices developed at national and international level;

- To provide support to the unit's managers within the scope of their activities.
